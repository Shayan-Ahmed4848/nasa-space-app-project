# Exoplanet Habitability Predictor

**Team Name:** Astro Data Science Collective  
**Project Type:** Data Science / Machine Learning  
**NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024**

## Objective
The **Exoplanet Habitability Predictor** is a machine learning-based project designed to predict the habitability of exoplanets based on features such as radius, orbital distance, and temperature. This tool aims to provide real-time predictions and insights about the potential habitability of discovered exoplanets.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Tools:**
  - Scikit-learn
  - Pandas
  - Streamlit
  - Matplotlib (for data visualization)
  
## Key Features
- **Real-time Predictions:** The model allows users to input planetary features (such as radius and orbital distance) to predict habitability.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Built using Streamlit, the web interface is intuitive and accessible for users.
- **Data Visualization:** Provides insightful charts and graphs for users to explore the data and predictions.
  
## Dataset
The data used in this project has been sourced from the **NASA Exoplanet Archive**. Key datasets include:
- `PlanetarySystems_data.csv`
- `PlanetarySystemsComposite_data.csv`
- `StellarHosts_data.csv`
- `TransitingPlanetsTable_data.csv`
